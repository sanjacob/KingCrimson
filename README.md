# King Crimson: YouTube Ad Skip for Android

Instantly fast forward YouTube ads when using the browser



## Why?

Some rather niche use cases where most third party ads are already blocked by a DNS or Pi-Hole, but YouTube ads due to their nature aren't.



## How?

By analysing media notifications and detecting those that correspond to YouTube ads, then simply skipping them.

You will need to provide the notification access permission for this.



## Caveats

This is still quite new, and probably won't block 100% of ads for everyone.
